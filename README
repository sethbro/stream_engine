*This code is not maintained!*. It was written for a particular project that never came to fruition, and I do not do Actionscript development anymore. Nonetheless, it's a decent foundation upon which to build webcam streaming solutions, so I'm open sourcing it in the hope that someone may find it useful.

h2. Overview

Start by taking a look at StreamEngine.as, which is an example application class. It subclasses StreamView, as should you. This subclass should be used as the root class of an FLA.

With your engine subclass, initialize a StreamController instance and call its addConnection method( connection_name, source, destination )

StreamEngine handles four types of streaming connections:

* Webcam -> Media server (network location)
* Webcam -> Local playback
* Media server -> Local playback
* Local file -> Local playback

It is not possible to save a webcam stream to a local file.

* StreamConnection handles the logic to connect the various interfaces.
* StreamDisplay is a Video instance for local playback.
* InfoPanel allows monitoring of video attributes during playback.
* StreamView is the application base class and can instantiate numerous StreamDisplays and panels for local playback.

h2. Caveats

* No audio support (it's stubbed out in the code but incomplete)
* Probably some hardcoded values in the code. I'll review and try to remove.
* I used successfully with an Amazon S3 Wowza Media Server instance. Your mileage may vary.
* No tests
